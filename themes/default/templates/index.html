        <h1>About the Tox network</h1>
        <h2>What is the Tox network and why is it better than centralized services?</h2>
      </header>

          <p>
            <strong>Tox</strong> began a few years ago, <em>in the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks regarding <strong>NSA spying</strong> activity</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea was <strong>to create an instant messaging protocol</strong> that ran <strong>without</strong> any kind of central servers. The system would be <strong>distributed</strong>, <strong>peer-to-peer</strong>, and <strong>encrypted</strong> <strong>end-to-end</strong>, with no way to disable any of the encryption features; at the same time, the protocol would be <strong>easily usable by the layperson</strong> with no practical knowledge of cryptography or distributed systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Fast-forward a few years to today</em>, and there exist several independent <strong>Tox</strong> client projects, and the original <strong>Tox core library</strong> implementation is nearing completion (in terms of features). <strong>Tox</strong> (both core and clients) has <em>thousands of users</em>, <em>hundreds of contributors</em>, and the project shows <em>no sign of slowing down</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Recently</em>, a group of <em>some of the project's major contributors</em> have formed <strong>The Tox Project</strong>, an organization built around <em>the protection</em>, <em>promotion</em>, and advancement of <strong>Tox</strong> and its development.
